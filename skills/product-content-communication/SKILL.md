Produce concise, audience-appropriate product documentation and launch messaging.

## Workflow

1. Clarify audience and purpose:
   - Internal vs. external, sales/support vs. users
   - Tone, length, and delivery format
2. Draft the artifact:
   - Structured sections, clear headings, and scannable content
   - Highlight value, scope, and success metrics when applicable
3. Review for clarity:
   - Remove ambiguity, define terms, and ensure consistency
