name: product-kickstart
description: Kickstart a new product project when the full flow is unclear by framing the problem, defining goals, drafting initial requirements, outlining a rough roadmap, and proposing success metrics and research needs. Use when the user wants a 0→1 product start or end-to-end PM kickoff. Do not use for deep competitive research or detailed UX design deliverables.
---

Provide a fast, structured product kickoff that turns ambiguity into an initial plan.

## Workflow

1. Frame the problem:
   - Target users, pain points, business goals
   - Assumptions, constraints, and open questions
2. Establish scope and requirements:
   - Success criteria, MVP scope, key user stories
   - Risks and dependencies
3. Outline the initial plan:
   - Rough roadmap and milestones
   - Metrics/KPI tree and validation or research tasks
