Create clear, structured UX visuals that communicate user flows and product concepts.

## Workflow

1. Define the persona and scenario:
   - User type, goals, and context
   - Key touchpoints and pain points
2. Produce the visual artifact:
   - Journey map, wireframe, or comparison visual with labels
   - Emphasize steps, emotions, and friction points
3. Summarize insights:
   - Highlight moments of delight or risk
   - Suggest follow-up design questions
