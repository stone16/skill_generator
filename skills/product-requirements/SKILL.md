description: Draft product requirement artifacts (PRD, user stories, acceptance criteria, scope, risks, open questions) from a defined problem or feature idea. Use when the user needs a requirements/spec document or clear success criteria. Do not use for roadmap prioritization, experiments/metrics, or market research.

Create crisp, testable product requirements that align stakeholders on scope, goals, and success criteria.

## Workflow

1. Clarify intent and context:
   - Target users, problem statement, business goals
   - Constraints (timeline, platforms, privacy/compliance)
   - Existing research, feedback, or roadmap context
2. Produce structured requirements:
   - Goals/non-goals, assumptions, scope boundaries
   - User stories with acceptance criteria
   - Functional + non-functional requirements
   - Edge cases, risks, and open questions
3. Provide next steps:
   - Validation plan (research, prototype, tech spikes)
   - Dependencies and handoffs (design, eng, data, legal)
