description: Define success metrics, KPI trees, and experiment plans (hypotheses, variants, metrics, sample size, analysis) for a feature or growth initiative. Use when the user needs measurement or A/B test design. Do not use for roadmap prioritization or PRD drafting.
---

Turn product goals into measurable metrics and rigorous experiment plans.

## Workflow

1. Understand the goal and funnel:
   - Objective, target users, and baseline performance
   - Event taxonomy and data availability
2. Define measurement:
   - North star metric, supporting KPIs, guardrails
   - Metric definitions and instrumentation requirements
3. Plan experiments:
   - Hypothesis, variants, success criteria
   - Sample size/power considerations and analysis plan
   - Risks, biases, and rollout strategy
