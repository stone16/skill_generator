name: product-roadmap-prioritization
description: Prioritize product initiatives and build roadmaps (RICE/ICE/WSJF, sequencing, milestones, trade-offs) based on goals, impact, effort, and dependencies. Use when the user needs a prioritized plan, vision framing, or monetization options. Do not use for writing PRDs or designing experiments.
---

Create transparent, defensible prioritization and sequencing for product work.

## Workflow

1. Collect inputs:
   - Strategic objectives, OKRs, revenue or adoption targets
   - Candidate initiatives, effort ranges, dependencies
   - Constraints (teams, deadlines, platform commitments)
2. Apply prioritization:
   - Choose a scoring model (RICE/ICE/WSJF) and document assumptions
   - Highlight trade-offs, risks, and sensitivity to key inputs
3. Output roadmap artifacts:
   - Ranked backlog with rationale
   - Milestones, releases, and dependency map
   - Vision framing or monetization options when requested
